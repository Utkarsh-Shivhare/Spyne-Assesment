Approach:
The project aimed to develop a model for predicting car angles using a pretrained model, EfficientNet-B0, known for its efficiency and performance. Data was cleaned, preprocessed, and split into training, validation, and testing sets. The pretrained model was fine-tuned over multiple epochs, with careful testing to determine the optimal number of epochs to prevent overfitting and ensure the model achieved its best performance.

Challenges:

Data Preparation: Handling missing values and inconsistencies was a time-consuming step.
Epoch Tuning: Iterative testing was required to balance the number of epochs for optimal model performance without overtraining.
Dependency Management: Issues with PyTorch libraries needed troubleshooting to ensure smooth execution.

Results:
Using the pretrained EfficientNet-B0 model significantly improved training efficiency and accuracy. The final model achieved a near 95% accuracy, with the F1 Score trends confirming that it was trained optimally and performed as expected.
